# WatchOut

An app to help you make your grocering list while keeping track of what you tend to waste.

# How It Works

- Scan your grocery list (can be handwritten)
- Verify your list and update quantities
- List is added to history
- Say what you wasted during the week
- The app keeps track of the most wasted items
- Next time you make a grocery list, it will tell you what items you tend to test
